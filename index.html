The principles of Chaos—Order, and Expansion—Compression were areas of focus as applied to how a person views and interacts with objects in space or the human machine (object) interface.
Of particular interest was how the distance between a viewer and an object, or the scale of a person in a volumetric space changes how an environment and the objects within are perceived, from near to far — a sort of "look-peek-examine" action. As a viewer moves closer to an object, the object occupies a larger portion of the field of view (the object gets bigger). As the person moves farther away, the object gets smaller, and the viewer becomes aware of surrounding context whether it is negative space or other objects around it.
In practice, this treatment of imagery in both two and three dimensions is commonplace: photo books, catalogues raisonnes, publications and architecture are all representative cases. By playing with scale, negative space, and juxtaposition, opportunities for closer inspection are created, as seen when a person steps into a gallery and walks closer towards an image to examine it. At the same time, visual hierarchy and interest are created when viewed as a whole, leading the eye towards areas of emphasis. Juxtaposition can suggest narrative and relationship between objects as well.</textarea>
